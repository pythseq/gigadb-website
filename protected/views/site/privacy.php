                GigaDB has implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security which we deem appropriate, taking into account the categories of data we collect and the way we process it.

                <p>
                For the purpose of monitoring and improving online services, planning and scientific review, GigaDB will keep its own records of usage and may use services provided by other organisations. GigaDB may make information about the total volume of usage of particular software or data available to third party organisations who supply the software or databases without details of any individual’s use.

When you contribute scientific data to a database through our website or other submission tools, this information will be released at a time and in a manner consistent with the scientific data publication and we may store it permanently.
If you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on or to our websites or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on any of our services, we may use your personal information to stop such behaviour.
